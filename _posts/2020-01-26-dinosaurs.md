Our society has a set of ideas about how we expect men and women to dress, behave, and present themselves. This has been happening from the centuries . Though ,we humans are evolving but our mindset about the gendered roles aren’t.

### What are gendered roles?
Gender roles in society means how we’re expected to act, speak, dress, groom, and conduct ourselves based upon our assigned sex. For example, girls and women are generally expected to dress in typically feminine ways and be polite, accommodating, and nurturing. Men are generally expected to be strong, aggressive, and bold.

The day a child is born it’s applicable. If a girl is born the hospital do a pink decor and if a boy is born it’s blue. Weather we like it or not but the society never let us forget about our gendered roles. Touchwood , I’m born in a family where my parents didn’t discriminate or applied these gendered roles *intentionally* to me but society, relatives around me did so .

### Foundation of gender bias
Girls play with the dolls.

Boys play with the cars.

Girls admire princesses.

Boys admire superheroes.

Girls should play Indoor games, read and draw.

Boys should play outdoors.

Save money for daughter’s marriage.

Save money for son’s education.

Women take care of the children.

Men take care of the finances.

### Did we ever ask ourselves WHY?

Why girls play with the dolls?

Why boys play with the cars?

Why girls admire princesses?

Why boys admire superheroes?

Why girls should play Indoor games, read and draw?

Why boys should play outdoors?

Why save money for daughter’s marriage ?

Why save money for son’s education?

Why women take care of the children?

Why men take care of the finances?

Well the most common statements are “we are supposed to do so” or “this is how it works” or maybe “ this is the conventional way”.
This is the problem that we’re told from the childhood who we’re supposed to be on the basis of our Sex.

### Who are these people ?
They could be any people whom a child is surrounded from.
Parents, family, relatives, neighbors , teachers, pears , internet and television.

### What can we do about it ?
The first step is to acknowledge that this is a major hindrance self expression and development that exists in our society.
We have to be more sensative,aware and conscious of what we speak.
Parents are supposed to provide an environment free from gender bias to their child.
School and teaches play a very vital role in this area . Gender sensitizations trainings should be concluded for teachers and the studnents both.
Gender styreotype is so deeply roots in us that we need to make conscious and continuous effects to eliminate this stereotype .
