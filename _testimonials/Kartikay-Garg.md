**21 activities for happiness!**
<br>
The 2 day workshop is a crash course in Happiness exploring simple yet efficient ways to achieve happiness in day to day life. 21 activities that follow are equally interesting and integral to the whole program and can be easily adopted in our daily routine.
<br> Huge thumbs up to Ridhi for being such an awesome guide through this journey. I would highly recommend this worshop to anyone who wishes to understand happiness from an unorthodox perspective. Looking forward to attend sessions on various other topics.
