**Really Refreshing!**
<br>
The program was well stitched with discussions around numerous aspects of our lives. Ridhi's effervescent personality, her presentation skills and the well-focused activities for illustration in the program got me hooked in no time.
<br>
While the couple of sessions that I attended were a good break in a busy day, the real game changer was the follow-up 21 day plan that Ridhi gave us, spending 5-10 minutes daily addressing various things that we end up neglecting or even don't realize are worth consideration.
<br>
I would like to thank Ridhi for organizing this phenomenal program and giving it such a personal touch.
