**You Truly Get To Know Happiness!**
<br>
There are wide array of emotions that we witness in our lives and through this workshop I got to know the importance of each and every one of them and more importantly how to use this for my betterment. It helped me understand how my happiness is closely dependent on my mindset and thought process.

Also I can surely conclude that Ridhi is passionate and an awesome coach. She has a knack for this kind of training because she was able to gauge what I was trying to express during and after workshop which is pretty great.
