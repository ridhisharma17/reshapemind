With the organization sizes increasing by each passing day, **Diversity** training becomes very important to make people aware and respect the varied diversity of people working in a organization. Lack of such awareness often creates unhealthy working space where a minority group with in an organization might feel **"unincluded"**.  
This training helps employees become more aware of **unconscious bias** and other barriers that hinder the inclusion of several diverse groups. Main focus of this training is to motivate positive behaviors and attitudes amongst employees and individuals which are essential for creating and maintaining a respectful **inclusive workplace**.
